These are messages in chatrooms that are made up of a few different characters that together form pictures like a christmas tree or a middle finger.\n2) It blocks extremely long sentences uttered in chatrooms, filtering out copy/paste spam like long rants\n3) It blocks private messages containing sentences you consider spam, for example messages trying to sell you foobar."
