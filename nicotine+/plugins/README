README Concerning plugins for N+


FOR EVERYBODY

The plugin system is in its infant stage, a lot of things aren't implemented yet
and a few things might be buggy. The provided plugins should be regarded as
documentation and shouldn't be loaded unless you're willing to break things.


FOR END USERS

In order to get the plugins working you need to copy them to
~/.nicotine/plugins, creating this directory if it doesn't exist yet. Plugins
will be loaded upon startup, and can be reloaded with /reload. This reload
command does not always completely reload the plugins due to the way Python
works, in some cases a restart of N+ is needed to get new versions working.


FOR DEVELOPERS

There are two kinds of actions you can hook into:

- Events: gives the plugin the ability to alter things. These are time
  critical, plugins should finish their execution as fast as possible. Let me
  repeat that: every ms you linger around processing the user will be looking
  at a frozen N+. 
- Notifications: gives the plugin the ability to respond to things, without
  being able to alter them. The plugin can take as long as it wants. This is
  the preferred action to hook into, only use Events if you really have to.

For more help examine the pluginsystem.py and the example plugins. There is no
documentation except for the example plugins.
