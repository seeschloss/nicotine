 - Hyriand (founder of nicotine)
till 1.0.8 you could bug him... later version (1.2.x) are cleaned up and maintained by Nicotine+ Dev.Team.. DO NOT BUG Hyriand
if you have problems!! Instead, send him a compliment, thank him for the trouble he took to write Nicotine :)

Hyriand's history TODO:
	* Find similar / continue existing download (DONE!)
  	* Keyboard list selection [DONE!]
  * Autocompletion:
	* Show popup menu when multiple completions are possible
	* Context sensitive autocompletion
	* Transfer logs (what, where, from whom, what error) [DONE!]
	* Connect / disconnect from distributed network depending on "max search results"

   * Full core / gui separation [Wrote MuseekDaemon]
   * Rewrite GUI in C and hope it's faster [...]
   * Create (n)curses gui [...]

Long term / permanent term:
  * Internationalization ("i18n") [DONE!]
  * Keep "core" in sync with PySoulSeek [DONE!]
  * Keep up with protocol changes [DONE!]

  * Undetermined term:
	* Win32 packages and installer (requires a magical speed-up first, which 
	  isn't going to happen any time soon, but with core/gui separation, a
	  native win32 gui should be possible) [DONE!]
