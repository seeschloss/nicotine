HowTo translate
================
To update the .pot file (template)
	a) Run the 'tr_gen' script or...
	b) Copy nicotine+/nicotine to nicotine.py and run  the following 
           command from the nicotine+ directory:
		xgettext -k_ -kN_ -o messages.pot *.py */*.py */*/*.py
	   Then remove the temporary nicotine.py

To create a new language
	Create a subdirectory under nicotine+/languages/
	for your translation. Copy the 'nicotine.pot' to that subdirectory and 
	rename it to 'nicotine.po'. Edit this file with poedit or the editor 
	of your choice.

To update all language .po files
	Run following command from the nicotine+/languages directory:
		find ./ -iname *.po -exec  msgmerge -U {} nicotine.pot \;
	Then, each nicotine.po will need to be updated with the new translations.

To update just the language .po file you are working on
	Change to the directory of the translation and run:
		msgmerge -U nicotine.po ../nicotine.pot

Convert nicotine.po to nicotine.mo
	When finished editing the .po, in the language's subdirectory, 
	do the following command:
		msgfmt nicotine.po -o nicotine.mo


After nicotine has been installed, the new .mo files will be 
in /usr/shares/locale/$LANGUAGE/LC_MESSAGES/

For testing, you can copy them there, yourself (if you have permissions)

USERS:

For Nicotine to know you want a certain translation, your locale needs to be set to that language.
