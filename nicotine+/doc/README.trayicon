To build the trayicon extension module, change to the "trayicon"
subdirectory and run the "autogen.py" script using the python version
that you run nicotine with. Then, as root, type "make install" and it should
build the trayicon.so module and place it in the appropriate directory.

Or, you can run the "trayicon-install" script, which does the same thing 
in one go.
