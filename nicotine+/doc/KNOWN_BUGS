Nicotine+ Known Bugs
====================
 * Note that missing features are not bugs :-) (quote from alexbk)
 * Search results can be quite slow.. Problem is being worked on..
 * Maxing out the operating system's allowed Sockets (open files) will result
   in all sorts of evil pango errors and general havoc. It may even cause
   Nicotine-Plus to crash or enter a cpu-hogging loop. Win32's socket limit is
   very easy to reach. since it's quite low.
