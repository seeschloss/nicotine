1.2.7 Release (25th February 2007)

GENERAL CHANGES
 * Window size is restored on startup
 * Background color of entry boxes, text views and list views is now changeable
   and all lists foreground color changes with the 'list text' option.
 * Added some padding around various widgets
 * Tabs can be reordered on the fly, now (Requires PyGTK 2.10) Also, Chat Room
   tab positions are saved in their reordered position.
 * Per-file identation consistancy was drastically improved. transfers.py, 
   slskproto.py and a few others were really bad.

SETTINGS
 * Added an Import Config frame to Settings, which duplicates the functionality
   of nicotine-import-winconfig. User can now easily import config options
   from the official Windows Soulseek client's config directory. Support for importing
   the ignore list was also added to nicotine-import-winconfig.
 * Translux (pseudo-transparent TextViews) is an old easter egg that is now
   customizable in UI Settings.
 * Transfer settings was rearranged and organized with expanders
 * Transfer settings has a new combo box for selecting which users are allowed
   to initiate uploading files to you. Trusted users are set in the buddy list.
 * Added several tooltips to Settings' transfer widgets in hopes of providing
   better explanations of some of the more complex functionality.
   
USERLIST
 * Comments in Buddy List can now be edited in-list by clicking twice on the 
   comment column, not by double-clicking (which would open Private Chat).
 * Trusted checkbox column added to the buddy list. Trusted users are an
   optional selection of users to whom remote uploads can be limited.

CHAT
 * Usernames in the chat room log now have hotspots associated with them, 
   meaning they can be left-clicked on to load the same popup as you have in
   the users list.
 * Usernames are also colored based on Online, Away and Offline/In-Room status.
   This option can be disabled in UI Settings.
 * "User is away/online/offline" messages removed from Private Chat

   
TRANSFERS
 * Transfers are now sub-items in a one-step tree with the user as a parent
 * QuinoX's patch, a download filter: ( http://qtea.nl/tmp/nicotine+ ) was
   reworked a little and given a nice listview to add the Regular Expressions
   (filters) to. This feature will allow you to blacklist certain types of
   files, which may save you from the pointless downloading and cleanup of
   unwanted files.
 * Downloads and Uploads popup menus have a new item under the user submenu,
   "Select User's Transfers".
 * Uploads can be retried
 * The Size column now has the current file position and the total file size
 * Remotely-Initiated-Uploads will no longer be accepted if an Upload Queue 
   Notification message has not been sent, first. This means versions of 
   Nicotine+ earlier than 1.2.5 will not be able to initiate sending you files,
   no matter what your allowed uploaders is set to.
 
USER INFO
 * Stats were rearrange and the status of who is allowed to initiate uploads to
   the user was added.
 
USER BROWSE
 * The browsetreemodels functions were disabled, and file and folder treeviews 
   were reimplemented with code from the PyGTK2 museek client, Murmur.
 * Search now works slightly different. Queries match all files in a directory,
   and switch between matching directories each time.
 * Tree lines and a 'Directories' sorting header were added to the Folder Treeview
 * Upload Directories Recursive was added to Folders' Popup
 * An expand / collapse all directories button was added
 * Recursive downloads in User Browse now checks from > 100 files and displays
   a Warning dialog that gives you a chance to cancel downloading.
   
SEARCH
 * Search has a new popup window for displaying the metadata of search results.
   This popup is accessible after selecting 1 or more files and clicking on the
   "View Metadata of File(s)" popup menu item. From this window, you can also
   download file(s) or initiate browsing of the current file's user's shares.
   
NETWORKING
 * Handle all peer message unpacking with an exception handler. Should make us
   safer from malformed data sent by users.
 * Close peer connection when userinfo's or browse's close buttons are pressed.
   (This is to save bandwidth)
   
TRANSLATIONS
