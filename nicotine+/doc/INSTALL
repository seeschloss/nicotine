Linux/Unix installation
====================================================================
To install Nicotine, from the source tree run:

python setup.py install --prefix=<dir>

If you omit --prefix Nicotine will be installed into the python system
directory (typically /usr)

This is not recommended however, as there is no way to uninstall things
easily this way.


The recommended way of running Nicotine is from the source tree, which might
seem strange, but is no problem at all, especially if you are the only user of
the system that is interested in running Nicotine. From the source tree run:

python ./nicotine


Building RPM packages
====================================================================
You create a RPM from the source tree:

python setup.py bdist_rpm

which will create a binary RPM in the dist subdirectory of the source tree.


Creating RPM packages
====================================================================
Note: to build source distribution (.tar.bz2) from itself, run:

python setup.py sdist --formats=bztar
