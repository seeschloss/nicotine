Nicotine is a client for the SoulSeek filesharing network. It was "forked"
(and thus reuses a lot of code) from the PySoulSeek project by Alexander
Kanavin, and features (among other things) a completely new graphical user
interface. The homepage of PySoulSeek is http://sensi.org/~ak/pyslsk/


To use it on Linux/Unix and X11 you'll need all of the following:

* Gtk+ 2.0 or newer
* Python 2.2.3 or newer
* pygtk-1.99.16 or newer (may work with older version, but is *UNTESTED*)


I also recommend installing Python Ogg and Python Vorbis bindings.
They are not required, but if you install them, others will be able to
see the bitrates and the lengths of Ogg Vorbis files that you share.
Binary RPMS of the bindings for Python 2.2 are available at pyslsk 
homepage, source is available at the bindings homepage: 
http://www.andrewchatham.com/pyogg/
Debian users should install the python-pyvorbis package.


After installing nicotine (see INSTALL for that), the executable
to run is named 'nicotine'.


To bring up a context menu for items is a list, select them with the left
mousebutton first, and then right-click to bring up the context menu. These
menus will only show options available in the context of the selected items
(f.e. if you select search results from multiple users, actions on the user
will not be available). Pressing the tab key in a chatroom or a private chat
invokes nickname auto-completion.


If you want Nicotine to use your PySoulSeek configuration files, use:

nicotine -c ~/.pyslsk


Have fun, and if you want to contact me for any feedback (thank-yous,
bugreports, patches, etc) you can do so by emailing to:

ps. Please remember, not sharing kills P2P!
