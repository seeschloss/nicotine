Daelstorm's new TODO:

* Add a special list of rooms and toggle for buddying everyone in those room, if you are sharing list only.


------------------------

Hyriand's old TODO:

Short term;
  * Find similar / continue existing download
  * Keyboard list selection

Not-too-long term:
  * Autocompletion:
   * Show popup menu when multiple completions are possible
   * Context sensitive autocompletion
   * Transfer logs (what, where, from whom, what error)
   * Connect / disconnect from distributed network depending on "max search
     results"

  * Full core / gui separation
   * Rewrite GUI in C and hope it's faster 
   * Create (n)curses gui

Long term / permanent term:
  * Internationalization ("i18n")
  * Keep "core" in sync with PySoulSeek
  * Keep up with protocol changes

Undetermined term:
  * Win32 packages and installer (requires a magical speed-up first, which
    isn't going to happen any time soon, but with core/gui separation, a
    native win32 gui should be possible)


Want your feature here? Feel free to contact me and I'll consider it.
