TRANSLATORS:

1a) To create the .pot file (template), copy nicotine+/nicotine to nicotine.py and run 
    the following command from the nicotine+ directory:

    xgettext -k_ -kN_ -o messages.pot *.py */*.py */*/*.py

    Then remove the temporary nicotine.py
    
1b) or run the tr_gen script

2)  To update to language .po files, run following command from the 
    nicotine+/languages directory:

	find ./ -iname *.po -exec  msgmerge -U {} nicotine.pot \;

    Then, each nicotine.po will need to be updated with the new translations.
    
3)  Edit the nicotine.po file in the language directory, and then, when finished, in the language's
    directory, do the following command:

4)  msgfmt nicotine.po -o nicotine.mo

After nicotine has been installed, the new .mo files will be 
in /usr/shares/locale/$LANGUAGE/LC_MESSAGES/

For testing, you can copy them there, yourself (if you have permissions)
